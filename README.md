## Project Overview

**Escuelas de Programación** is a scalable Learning Management System (LMS) designed to deliver structured technical curricula. The platform currently operates as a high-performance Single Page Application (SPA), serving a comprehensive **Advanced C++ Module**.

The project is engineered for scalability, with a modular architecture ready to support future tracks in Python, Rust, and JavaScript. It focuses on rigorous assessment through a tiered examination system and practical coding challenges.

### Current Status
* **Production Ready:** The platform is fully deployed and operational.
* **Content Centric:** Features a complete C++ learning path backed by technical documentation.
* **Scalable Foundation:** Community and Resource interfaces are implemented, laying the groundwork for future user interaction and forum integration.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive C++ Curriculum
The pilot module offers a structured learning path divided into progressive chapters. Each section is backed by detailed documentation and practical examples, covering concepts from syntax fundamentals to memory management.

### 2. Tiered Assessment Engine
A robust testing system designed to validate knowledge retention through standardized exams:
* **Standard Exams:** Three distinct difficulty tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard), each consisting of **20 questions** to comprehensively test the user's understanding of the module.
* **Blitz Mode (Expert):** A randomized rapid-fire question engine designed for advanced users to test their reflexes on complex topics.

### 3. Practical Challenges & Solutions
Theory is reinforced through application.
* **Module Challenges:** Each learning module concludes with a practical coding challenge.
* **Alternative Questions:** Critical thinking questions with multiple-choice alternatives.
* **Integrated Solutions:** Full solution keys are provided for every challenge to ensure the learning loop is closed.

### 4. Community Infrastructure
The platform includes dedicated interfaces for **Community** and **Resources**, currently deployed as foundational UI elements in preparation for the upcoming user authentication and discussion forum systems.
